# Genomic-tools

This repository contains python scripts for performing common genomics analyses on fasta files. Additional tools will continue to be added over time. For now, clone this repository, then run the python script 'fasta_parser.py', ensuring that you are running this is an environment that has pandas and numpy installed. At this time the script only takes a valid fasta file as input and outputs a dataframe of information about the ORFs present in each sequence of the Fasta file. To run: `python fasta_parser.py <Fasta_file.fasta>`. Additional options include: `-r` to change the reading frame, `-s` to change the length of the substrings to extract, `--seq-id` to retrieve information about a specific sequence, and `-m` to specify a metric of interest.
